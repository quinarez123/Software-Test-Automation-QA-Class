## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure that the program is functional, properly read the requirements that the client has requested. It doesn't matter how sophisticated your program is, if it's not what the client requested then it will be considered a failure. As you build on the program, constantly refer back to the specifications to prevent deviation. Lastly test the program to make sure that it executes the intended function. As regards to security, you must begin the project with security in mind instead of leaving it to the last minute. 

## How do I intepret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
After consultation with the client, the developer or the product manager need to know what the client is exactly requesting and leaving nothing to ambiguity. AFter defining the user needs and converting them into features or functions, the developer must choose the best way to create this.

## How do I approach software design?
Software design approach will vary from person to person. People with different experiences and backgrounds operate differently with their own methods. My software approach involves planning in the forefront. One method that I adopted for planning is through the use of pseudocode. Pseudocode allows me to write the code in plain english and examine it to make sure that the logic is sound. I then research tools and frameworks that I believe will better assist me in writing the program.
